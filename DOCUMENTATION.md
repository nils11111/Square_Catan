## Project Overview

### Description
Square Catan is a complete Java implementation of the classic board game "The Settlers of Catan" (1995) by Klaus Teuber. The game has been adapted to use square tiles instead of hexagonal tiles, as allowed by the project requirements for a 7-point deduction. The application provides a fully functional, intuitive, and maintainable Java-based implementation with a modern JavaFX graphical user interface.

### Key Features
- **Complete Catan Game Rules**: Implements all core rules from the original 1995 game
- **Square Tile Board**: 6x6 grid with 36 tiles (19 playable + 17 additional)
- **Resource Management**: Wood, Brick, Ore, Grain, and Wool resources
- **Building System**: Settlements, Cities, and Roads with proper resource costs
- **Dice Rolling**: Two-dice system with resource production
- **Player Management**: Support for 2-4 players
- **Victory Conditions**: First player to reach 10 victory points wins
- **Setup Phase**: Proper forward and backward settlement/road placement
- **Trade System**: Player-to-player resource trading
- **Modern JavaFX GUI**: Clean, intuitive interface with real-time updates

### Project Requirements Compliance
✅ **All Core Requirements Met:**
- Complete implementation of 1995 Catan rules
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Easy to maintain, modify, and extend
- Stable and reliable operation
- English development language
- English documentation language
- English display language

✅ **Simplifications Applied (as required):**
- No development cards implemented
- No special cards implemented
- No expansions (Cities & Knights, etc.)
- Square tiles instead of hexagons (7-point deduction accepted)
- No sound effects, music, or animations
- No network functionality
- No computer opponents

## Architecture and Design

### Design Patterns
The project follows several key design patterns:

1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
   - **Model**: Game logic classes in `com.catan.model` package
   - **View**: UI components in `com.catan.ui` package
   - **Controller**: GameState acts as controller, managing game flow

2. **Observer Pattern**
   - UI components automatically update when game state changes
   - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

3. **Factory Pattern**
   - Used for creating game board elements (tiles, vertices, edges)
   - Centralized object creation with consistent initialization

4. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Different building validation strategies for setup vs. play phases
   - Flexible road network validation

## Game Rules Implementation

### Setup Phase
1. **Forward Round**: Players 1→2→3→4 place one settlement and one road each
2. **Backward Round**: Players 4→3→2→1 place one settlement and one road each
3. **Resource Collection**: Each player receives resources from tiles adjacent to their second settlement

**Implementation Details**:
- `GameState.setupPhase` tracks current setup phase
- `GameState.settlementBuilt` and `GameState.roadBuilt` track building progress
- Automatic player switching after both settlement and road are placed
- No resource costs during setup phase

### Main Game Phase
1. **Dice Rolling**: Current player rolls two dice (2-12)
2. **Resource Production**: All players with settlements/cities on tiles with the rolled number receive resources
3. **Building Phase**: Players can build settlements, cities, and roads using collected resources
4. **Trading**: Players can trade resources with each other
5. **Turn Progression**: Play passes to the next player

**Implementation Details**:
- Dice rolling uses `Math.random()` for two six-sided dice
- Resource production automatically calculated based on building locations
- Building validation includes resource cost checking
- Turn progression is automatic after dice rolling

### Building Rules

#### Settlements
- **Cost**: 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Grain + 1 Wool
- **Placement**: Any unoccupied vertex
- **Victory Points**: 1 point each
- **Resource Production**: 1 resource per adjacent tile when number is rolled

#### Cities
- **Cost**: 2 Grain + 3 Ore
- **Placement**: Upgrade existing settlement owned by the player
- **Victory Points**: 2 points each (1 additional when upgrading from settlement)
- **Resource Production**: 2 resources per adjacent tile when number is rolled

#### Roads
- **Cost**: 1 Wood + 1 Brick
- **Placement**: Must connect to existing buildings or road network (except in setup phase)
- **Network Validation**: Recursive depth-first search to validate connections

### Victory Conditions
- First player to reach 10 victory points wins
- Settlements: 1 victory point each
- Cities: 2 victory points each (1 additional point when upgrading from settlement)

### Resource Production
- **Forest**: Produces Wood
- **Hills**: Produces Brick
- **Mountains**: Produces Ore
